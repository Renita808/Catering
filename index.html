<h4>Our Mission</h4>
	<p id="mission">
in 2020, the novel coronavirus pandemic caused the cancellation of celebrations, weddings, baby showers, and other monumental events. Our business as traditional cateres collapsed. After our owner contracted the virus and spent three weeks recovering, she decided it was time to get on with her life and get back to business. That's when Lockdown Catering was born.
Out of necessity to allow life to continue, an important element to maintaining good mental health, we offer our serices. We will accommodate most requests, no matter how overly-cautious they may seem. Just ask us....we'll most likely say yes so your life-changing event can take place.
